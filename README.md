# Blazor .Net 8 Demo

This demo is meant to primarily demonstrate a comprehension of a very separated MVVM architecture.

### Notes:
    1. Client-side services were omitted for this demo.
    2. This is just an example to demonstrate a comprehension, I don't necessarily prefer over-architected software.

Also included is a basic implementation of a new .Net 8 Blazor component using RendermodeAuto.
