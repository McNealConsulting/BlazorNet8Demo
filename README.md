# Blazor .Net 8 Demo

### This demo is meant to primarily demonstrate a comprehension of a very separated MVVM architecture.

**Notes:**
    1. This is just an example to demonstrate a comprehension of the architecture, I don't necessarily prefer over-architected software.
    2. Client-side services were omitted for this demo.

Also included is a basic implementation of a new .Net 8 Blazor component using RendermodeAuto.
